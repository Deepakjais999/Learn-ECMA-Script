# Three ways to create a variables

1. let
2. var
3. const

## let:
Values will be available inside the block and sub-blocks only.

## var: 
Values will be available inside and outside of the block. This makes value available globally. 

## const:
Similar to 'let' values will be available only withing the block.
It can hold single value always. It will never allow second assignment.
